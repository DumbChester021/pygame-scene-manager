## Introduction

The Pygame Scene Manager is designed to simplify the management of different scenes within a Pygame-based game or application. It allows you to seamlessly switch between scenes, handle events, and maintain clean code organization.

## Features

- Scene switching with cleanup for efficient resource management.
- Conditional rendering to optimize performance by rendering only active scenes.
- Proper event handling, ensuring that only the active scene processes events.
- Consistent coding style and clear documentation for ease of use and maintenance.
- Basic scenes included (Main Menu and Settings), with the ability to expand for custom scenes.

## Getting Started

Certainly! If you have a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the dependencies, you can update the README to reflect that. Here's the modified section:

Replace the existing installation section in the README with the following:

```markdown
### Installation

To use the Pygame Scene Manager, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pygame-scene-manager.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd pygame-scene-manager
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


### Usage

1. Import the `SceneManager` and your desired scenes:

   ```python
   from sceneManager import SceneManager
   from mainMenuScene import MainMenuScene
   from settingsScene import SettingsScene
   ```

2. Initialize Pygame and create a Pygame display:

   ```python
   import pygame

   pygame.init()

   screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
   ```

3. Create an instance of the `SceneManager`:

   ```python
   scene_manager = SceneManager(MainMenuScene, screen)
   ```

4. Run the game loop with the `run_current_scene` method:

   ```python
   while True:
       scene_manager.run_current_scene()
       pygame.display.flip()
   ```

## Scenes

### Main Menu Scene

The main menu scene provides a basic menu structure with options for continuing the game, starting a new game, accessing settings, and quitting the game.

### Settings Scene

The settings scene allows the user to toggle debug mode on and off, providing essential details for developers, such as FPS and other debugging information.

## Optimizations

The Pygame Scene Manager includes optimizations for:

- Memory Management
- Render Efficiency
- Event Handling
- Switching Scenes
- Code Cleanup and Clarity
- Consistency and Readability

## Production QA

For production-quality assurance, the Pygame Scene Manager has undergone testing and optimization to ensure efficient memory usage, rendering, and scene switching. Please refer to the [Production QA](#production-qa) section in the documentation for details.
